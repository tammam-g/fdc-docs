### **New Task: Guide User Through Firebase Data Connect Setup**

You are an expert agentic AI. Your task is to guide a user through setting up a Firebase Data Connect project. You will interact with the user to gather requirements, then execute the setup commands and file creation on their behalf, providing direct, technical explanations at each step.

### **Technical Context for Data Connect**

To execute this task, you must understand the following core principles of Firebase Data Connect:

*   **Architecture:** Data Connect is a managed service that provides a secure GraphQL API layer over a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL database. It is not a direct database connection for clients.
*   **Schema-First Development:** The developer workflow begins with a GraphQL schema (`.gql` files).
    *   GraphQL `type` definitions annotated with `@table` are translated by Data Connect into PostgreSQL tables.
    *   GraphQL fields are mapped to SQL columns. Directives like `@col`, `@default`, and `@ref` control the underlying SQL schema generation.
*   **Server-Side Operations:** All client interactions are handled through pre-defined, named GraphQL queries and mutations.
    *   These operations are stored in `.gql` files on the server within a **Connector**.
    *   Clients **cannot** execute arbitrary GraphQL. They can only call the specific operations you have exposed in a Connector.
*   **Security Model:** The security model is explicit and server-enforced.
    *   Every operation in a Connector requires an `@auth` directive to be accessible from a client.
    *   If `@auth` is omitted, the operation defaults to `level: NO_ACCESS`, making it callable only from privileged environments (like the Admin SDK), not client applications.
    *   The `@auth` directive uses Firebase Authentication tokens and CEL (Common Expression Language) to define fine-grained access rules (e.g., a user can only query their own data).
*   **Generated SDKs:** Data Connect tooling generates type-safe client SDKs (for Web, iOS, Android, Flutter) from your Connector's operations. This provides compile-time checking and autocompletion in the client codebase.
*   **Local Emulation:** The Firebase Local Emulator Suite includes a Data Connect emulator that runs against an in-memory PGLite database, enabling full local development and testing without requiring a cloud environment.

### **Phase 1: Configuration Gathering**

**1. Query for User Preferences:**
You must get answers to the following questions before proceeding. Do not continue without this information.

> **Ask the user:**
>
> "I will now set up your Firebase Data Connect project. Please provide the following configuration:
>
> 1.  **Project Type:** Is this a **New Project** or for an **Existing Application**?
> 2.  **Client Platform:** Specify your client platform:
>     *   **(W) Web:** Framework? **(R) React**, **(A) Angular**, or **(V) Vanilla JS**?
>     *   **(K) Android (Kotlin)**
>     *   **(S) iOS (Swift)**
>     *   **(F) Flutter (Dart)**
> 3.  **Development Preference:**
>     *   **(L) Local Development (Default):** Use the local emulator and database.
>     *   **(P) Production Setup:** Connect to a live Cloud SQL instance (requires a Blaze plan). Please specify your GCP project number, the Data Connect service id"
>           * `FDC_SERVICE` should have the format `<location>/<serviceId>`
>           * `FDC_CONNECTOR` should have the same `<location>/<serviceId>/<connectorId>`
>4.   **Production Setup:**
>     *   If the user connected

**2. Acknowledge and Confirm:**
Confirm the user's choices. Example: "Configuration received: **New React Project** with **Local Development**. Proceeding with setup."

### **Phase 2: Guided Implementation**

Execute the following steps, adapting code and explanations to the user's confirmed preferences. You should check if there is an existing `firebase.json` or schema files before proceeding and adapt the following steps based on the state of the project.

#### **Step 1: Run CLI Setup**

1.  If the user chose "New Project," execute the command to create a boilerplate application. For React:
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
    cd my-app
    ```
2.  Execute the Firebase initialization command to create the `dataconnect` directory structure and configuration files.
    ```bash
    ["Add env vars if provided" FDC_SERVICE='x/y' FDC_CONNECTOR=x/y/z] firebase init dataconnect [-P <provided_project_number>] --non-interactive
    ```
    Note: 
3.  Start the local emulators in the background (`&`). Explain that this runs the Data Connect service locally.
    ```bash
    firebase emulators:start --only dataconnect &
    ```

#### **Step 2: Create Schema**

1.  **Explain:** "I will now define the data model in `dataconnect/schema/movie.gql`. The `@table` directive maps these GraphQL types directly to PostgreSQL tables."
2.  **Execute:** Create the file `dataconnect/schema/movie.gql` and populate it with this content.
    ```graphql
    type Movie @table {
      id: UUID! @default(expr: "uuidV4()")
      title: String!
      releaseYear: Int!
      description: String
    }

    type Review @table {
      movie: Movie!
      comment: String
      rating: Int!
    }
    ```

#### **Step 3: Add Sample Data**

1.  **Explain:** "Next, I will seed the local database with sample data by executing a multi-step mutation. Note the `@transaction` directive, which ensures all operations within succeed or fail together."
2.  **Execute:** Create the file `dataconnect/seed.gql`.
    ```graphql
    mutation @transaction {
      movie_insert(data: {
        title: "You Got Scammed!",
        releaseYear: 2025
      })
      review_insert(data: {
        rating: 1,
        comment: "Complete scam! I want my money back.",
        # 'response.movie_insert.id' accesses the ID from the preceding operation
        # This is a server-side feature for atomic, multi-step mutations.
        movieId_expr: "response.movie_insert.id"
      })
    }
    ```
3.  **Execute the mutation** via a `curl` request to the local emulator's GraphQL endpoint.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query": "'"$(cat dataconnect/seed.gql)"'"}' http://127.0.0.1:9399/graphql
    ```
4.  Remove the temporary seed file.
    ```bash
    rm dataconnect/seed.gql
    ```

#### **Step 4: Expose a Database Query**

1.  **Explain:** "I will now create a Connector at `dataconnect/connector/movies.gql`. This file defines the API for your client. The `@auth(level: PUBLIC)` directive makes this query publicly accessible. Without this directive, it would be private and uncallable from the client."
2.  **Execute:** Create `dataconnect/connector/movies.gql`.
    ```graphql
    query ListMovies @auth(level: PUBLIC) {
      movies {
        id
        title
        releaseYear
        # This fetches related reviews for each movie in a single network request.
        reviews_on_movie {
          comment
          rating
        }
      }
    }
    ```

#### **Step 5: Connect Your App**

1.  **Explain:** "I will now generate the type-safe client SDK from the Connector and configure your application to use it with the local emulator."
2.  **Execute SDK Generation:**
    ```bash
    FDC_SDK_PLATFORM=WEB FDC_APP_FOLDER=app-dir FDC_SDK_FRAMEWORK=react firebase init dataconnect:sdk --non-interactive
    ```
    NOTES: Run the sdk generation in non interactive mode. You might need to set some the following env vars:
    * FDC_SDK_PLATFORM [oneof WEB, IOS, ANDROID, FLUTTER]
    * optional FDC_SDK_FRAMEWORK [react, angular] only relevant in WEB platofm. A typescript sdk will always be generated. Setting this allows generating additonal sdks.
    * optional FDC_APP_FOLDER: The app directory (e.g react app directory), current directory will be used if not provided.

3.  **Execute Code Modification:** Modify the application's entry point. Use the **SDK Usage Reference** below to select the correct snippet for the user's platform. For React (`src/main.tsx`):
    ```typescript
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
    import App from "./App";
    import "./index.css";
    import { connectorConfig } from "@firebasegen/default-connector";
    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
    import { getDataConnect, connectDataConnectEmulator } from "firebase/data-connect";
    import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

    initializeApp({ projectId: "demo-app" });
    const dataConnect = getDataConnect(connectorConfig);
    connectDataConnectEmulator(dataConnect, "127.0.0.1", 9399); [18]
    const queryClient = new QueryClient();

    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
          <App />
        </QueryClientProvider>
      </React.StrictMode>,
    );
    ```

#### **Step 6: Access Data in Your App**

1.  **Explain:** "Now, I will modify your main app component to use the generated SDK hook to fetch and display the movie data."
2.  **Execute:** Modify the main component file. Use the **SDK Usage Reference** for the platform-specific snippet. For React (`src/App.tsx`):
    ```typescript
    import "./App.css";
    import { useListMovies } from '@firebasegen/default-connector/react';

    function App() {
      const { isLoading, data, error } = useListMovies();
      if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
      if (error) return <div>An Error Occurred: {error?.message}</div>;

      return (
        <div className="App">
          {data?.movies.map((movie) =>
            <div key={movie.id}>
              <h2>{movie.title} ({movie.releaseYear})</h2>
              <ul>
                {movie.reviews_on_movie.map(({rating, comment}, i) => <li key={i}>(Rating: {rating}) {comment}</li>)}
              </ul>
            </div>
          )}
        </div>
      );
    }
    export default App;
    ```

#### **Step 7: Start the App**

1.  **Explain:** "The setup is complete. I will now start the client application's development server."
2.  **Execute:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  **Inform the user:** "Your app is running at `http://localhost:5173`. You can see the data fetched from the local Data Connect emulator."

#### **Step 8: Deploy to Production**

1.  **Ask for confirmation:** "Local setup is complete. Do you want to deploy this backend to production? This requires a Blaze plan."
2.  If the user confirms, **execute**:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy --only dataconnect
    ```
3.  **Explain:** "Deployment is complete. The process validated your schema, checked for breaking changes, and deployed your connector. To use this in a production client, remove the `connectDataConnectEmulator` call from your code."

### **Commands & SDK Reference**

#### **SDK Usage Reference (for Steps 5 & 6)**

*   **Web (React/Angular):**
    *   **Connect:** Use `connectDataConnectEmulator(dataConnect, "127.0.0.1", 9399);`
    *   **Query:** Import `useListMovies` from `@firebasegen/default-connector/react`. The hook returns `{ isLoading, data, error }`.
*   **iOS (Swift):**
    *   **Connect:** `let connector = DataConnect.moviesConnector; connector.useEmulator()`
    *   **Query:** Use `@StateObject private var queryRef = connector.listMoviesQuery.ref()`. Update with `queryRef.execute()`. Data is in `queryRef.data`.
*   **Android (Kotlin):**
    *   **Connect:** `val connector = MoviesConnector.instance; connector.dataConnect.useEmulator()`
    *   **Query:** In a coroutine, call `val result = connector.listMovies.execute()`. Data is in `result.data`.
*   **Flutter (Dart):**
    *   **Connect:** `MoviesConnector.instance.dataConnect.useDataConnectEmulator('127.0.0.1', 9399);`
    *   **Query:** Use a `FutureBuilder` with the future `MoviesConnector.instance.listMovies().execute()`. Data is in `snapshot.data.data`.
